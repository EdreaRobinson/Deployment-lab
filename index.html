        <p style="text-align: left;">We are small, in-home, French Bulldog breeders and enthusiasts.  We have owned Frenchies for 4 years, and researched the breed for about 3 years before finally purchasing one.  We produced our first litters in 2020!  We absolutely love the breed, and have invested a lot of time, effort, and money into building a high-quality breeding program.  
            
        All of our puppies come with prepaid AKC registration, age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, 1 year health guarantee, 1 month pet insurance, puppy pack, and lifelong support and tips.  We are very selective of who our pups are sold to...and are very selective of where we purchase from, also.
        
        We do video calls with all prospective buyers, prior to accepting deposits, to give them the opportunity to see the pups, the mom, and the environment and conditions they are raised in.  To keep up with our litters, please follow us on Facebook, Instagram, or TikTok!</p>
